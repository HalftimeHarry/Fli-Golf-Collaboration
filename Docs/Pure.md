PURE MOBILE PRODUCTIONS TESTIMONIAL

Pure Mobile Productions is currently negotiating contracts with the FLI GOLF
LEAGUE. As a leader in live sports productions, we will be bringing our years of
expertise and resources to this tour. Our contracts have included live
broadcasting for partners such as ESPN, FOX SPORTS, AND FANDUEL. It is through
these pre-established relationships that we will present the live FLI GOLF
tournaments to the major sports networks in partnership with FLI GOLF. Our
hopes are to receive dedicated time slots to showcase the tournaments live as
well as marketing and advertising considerations for the league.
We here at Pure Mobile Productions strongly believe that disc golf, as a sport, is
primed and ready for the national spotlight and we will be happy to utilize our
skill sets as a company and management team to see that come to fruition.
