Alexander Smart - Chief Financial Officer
Alexander Smart joined the Marine Corps in July 1980 and was honorably discharged in August 1991. Every rank Mr. Smart attained, from E-2/PFC to E-6/SSGT, was through meritorious promotion, which is an accelerated promotion based solely on performance. When entering the business world, Mr. Smart recognized that the highest paid employees were the people who drove company revenues. He thus started his 31- year career of stellar performance in sales and management.
As the VP of sales for INFO 4 CARS, Mr. Smart helped earn an exclusive contract with Walmart and Sam’s Club. This program generated revenues in excess of $5 million per year through “Private Lot Events” across the nation. Mr. Smart began to further develop his sales and marketing talents as the National Sales Director for an upstart independent yellow pages company called Yellow Directory Fast Pages. Taking the helm, he hired, trained, assisted, and motivated sales reps in achieving over $250,000 in sales in just eight months. Determined to maximize his success, in January of 2005 he stepped out on his own to launch “Your Community Yellow Pages and Community Discount Magazine.” His daily focus on hiring, training, and motivating the sales force resulted in sales of $1.5 Million in 2005, $3 Million in 2006, and $3.2 Million in 2007. His remarkable success with this company caught the attention of The Yellow Pages and negotiations began for a multi-million-dollar buyout of the company.
Based on his experience as a sales manager for MCI, Sprint and Broadwing Communications, major companies in telecommunications industry, Mr. Smart saw the direction that online internet marketing was going and decided that the most secure path to continued sustained growth was in the recession-proof telecommunications industry. He mobilized his talents and entered the telecom arena, generating over $1.8 million in revenue in 2008 – 2009. Mr. Smart then transitioned to cellular, utilizing small independent stores nationwide to sell products and services. The company was able to sell the brand’s customer base within three (3) years.

Sponsorships:

    Major Sponsors $6,000,000: 2 PER SEASON/$3,000,000 PER SPONSOR- INCLUDED IN ALL TOURNAMENT RELATED ADVERTISING MATERIAL INCLUDING RADIO, PRINT, WEBISTE, AND SOCIAL MEDIA. EACH ACQUIRE 30% OF AVAILABLE MAJOR ON-SITE MARKETING SPACE. THIS INCLUDES TEE BOXES, BASKETS, AND ON-COURSE OBJECTS. TARGET COMPANY GENRES - SPORTSBOOKS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

BETMGM (Major sportsbook sponsors): \*1st option
Takes ALL action on the tournaments. By targeting colleges that already have athletic department ties to BETMGM we will have full access to the home course and college grounds staff/disc golf clubs. This tour will further solidify the relationship between BETMGM and the college. This sponsorship will also solidify the sportsbook as the undisputed leader in the United States Disc Golf gambling world.

FANDUEL: \*2ND option
FanDuel is a leader in sports gambling with college students. They are established in IVY League sports college and staple college games such as corn hole. After their acquisition of TVG, their desperation to expand into new sports and college athletics makes them a primed and ready 2nd option for our tour.

Cash-app/Venmo (Financial Sponsors): \*1st option
We are looking for a major financial sponsor that has a strong foothold within the college demographic. Easy cash transfer apps have become the major way for college students to exchange money for day-to-day purchases. By offering one of these institutions a chance to enhance their marketing on IVY League school campuses, they will jump at the opportunity. We can also offer discounts for fans who use one of these companies to purchase tickets and merchandise. This is a marketing opportunity they cannot pass on.

Major financial institution: \*2nd option
If we cannot find a cash transfer company who sees the opportunity, we will target financial institutions that are established in the IVY League college community. This is the low hanging fruit in our opinion and will be an easy avenue as a secondary option. Examples would be PayPal or ApplePay

TIER 1 SPONSORS $6,000,000: 4 PER SEASON/$1,500,000 PER SEASON - INCLUDED IN TOURNAMENT RELATED ADVERTISING MATERIAL INCLUDING RADIO, PRINT, AND SOCIAL MEDIA. EACH ACQUIRE 10% OF AVAILABLE MAJOR MARKETING SPACE. THIS INCLUDES TEE BOXES, BASKETS, AND ON-COURSE OBJECTS. TARGET COMPANY GENRES - 2 INTERNATIONAL DISC GOLF BRANDS AND 2 U.S BASED BRANDS.

Dynamic Discs (Major U.S based disc golf brands):
Dynamic Disc is the 3rd largest U.S based disc golf brand. They sponsor almost every major disc golf tournament in the world. We are targeting them because they represent The Trilogy which includes Dynamic Discs, Westside Discs, and Latitude 64. These are some of the largest disc golf brands in the world. This sponsorship allows all their brands to heavily influence the next generation of competitive disc golf players in every major D.G country.

MVP DISC SPORTS  
MVP Disc Sports is the 4th largest U.S based disc golf brand. They have a lower sponsorship presence in the U.S than they do internationally. This is due to their prime international tournament presence with their sister brand. FLI GOLF TOUR is an opportunity to advance their position with the college disc golf community, who represent the major numbers in yearly registered rounds of D.G played.

Latitude 64 (Major International based Disc Golf Brands):
As one of the major brands in The Trilogy group, they are based in one of the largest disc golf countries in the world, SWEDEN. They are a huge presence in the European professional disc golf scene. An opportunity to sponsor a professional tournament on the highest academic campuses in America, nationally televised, is not something they will be able to turn down.

Axiom Discs:
Axiom Discs are known in the disc golf industry as the FLASHY DISCS! They have vibrant artwork and futuristic styles that attract the "Higher Class" disc golfer. With our tournaments being held at IVY League schools, this is a brand that will attract the higher end disc golf shopper and/or player. Although they are owned by MVP Disc Sports in Michigan, they have major influence in disc golf around the world.

    TIER 2 SPONSORS $1,200,000: 4 PER SEASON/$300,00,000 PER SEASON PLUS SUPPLIES - INCLUDED IN ALL FOOD AND BEVERAGE RELATED ADVERTISING MATERIAL INCLUDING RADIO, PRINT, WEBISTE, AND SOCIAL MEDIA.

TARGET COMPANY GENRES - FOOD AND BEVERAGE COMPANIES.

Mananalu Pure Water (Non-Plastic Water Company Founded by Jason Mamoa): \*1st water choice
As one of the largest celebrities in the world, Jason Mamoa has founded a water company that prides itself on providing purified water that is supplied in non-plastic and reusable containers. This marketing angle plays directly into the foundations of disc golf which is to enjoy and preserve the amazing landscape our great country provides us. This sponsorship is a highway into the IVE League college athletic scene for their brand.

PepsiCO: (Beverage company that can supply vast amount of beverage options): *1st beverage choice
As a partner of MGM Resorts, PepsiCo is an obvious target for FLI Disc Golf. Also, as the second largest sponsor of professional sports tournaments in the U.S, they will be more than ready to enter the progressive Disc Golf market. With alcohol brand ties, they can also be a potential alcohol or second water option sponsor for the tour.
Anheuser-Busch (top 3 alcohol distributor in the U.S): *1st choice
As a partner of MGM Resorts and top choice of legal age college students around the country, this is the obvious alcohol brand to choose for the FLI Golf tour. Their vast network of distribution options is perfect for our outdoor tour.

Five Guys (Top 5 fast food chain on college campuses): \*1st choice
With a handheld food menu and rural America approved larger than normal portions, Five Guys has American fan favorites like custom hot-dogs and burgers. With the addition of local food truck menus, this staple in the college food community will be a perfect fit for FLI Golf.

Merchandise Sales: _All numbers are based on low-end annual projections_
Tournament Sales $48,000: Average $8 profit per sale multiplied by an average of 500 sales per tournament. This number is then multiplied by 12 tournaments per season. Our strategy is to focus on limited edition college collab logos and designs for clothing and equipment collections at each tournament to ensure 100% merchandise sell-out.
$8 x 500 = $4,000 / $4,000 x 12 tournaments = $48,000
Online Sales $100,000: With limited time available during the tournament for merchandise sales, our expectation is to double the tournament sales number throughout the year through our online platforms including our website, social media, and partner retail locations.
Ticket Sales: _All ticket sales are based on annual low-end projections_
General Admission $120,000: A minimum of 1000 general admission tickets sold per tournament at a price of $10 per ticket. General admission tickets qualify for "FIRST 500".
$10 x 1000 = $10,000 / $10,000 x 12 tournaments = $120,000
VIP Tickets $120,000: These tickets are limited in number and allow access to the closest tee box areas, basket areas, and obstacle areas. Access to media day and practice round as well as provided with a coupon for 50% OFF ANY TEAM SHIRT from our on-site store. VIP Tickets qualify for "FIRST 500" also.
$20 x $500 = $10,000 / $10,000 x 12 tournaments = $120,000
EXPENSES

COURSE RENTAL AND MAINTENANCE
Landscaping $100,000 per year: The truly great benefit to the game of Disc Golf is that is takes place in the great American outdoors, making landscaping needs almost non-existent. Minimum materials will be needed on-hand to decorate a course. We will be using fake and reusable items so upfront and ongoing costs will remain as low as possible. Also, by hosting the tournaments on a college campus that competes in the CDGL (College Disc Golf League), they will have a campus course or home course nearby that we can utilize for free. Materials we will keep on hand are items including multiple sizes of fake trees, fake bushes, fake vines, large foam rocks/boulders, netting, fake hay bales, and wood chips.

MARKETING & PROMOTION

Advertising $200,000 per year: Music streaming apps will be the leader in our advertising efforts. We will be using targeted Spotify and Apple Music ads for the build-up of each tournament. By targeting the college campus and surrounding city environments, we will capture both the disc gold music lovers and the local music audience who will be happy to hear of a live show at the end of the tournament. These are the top 2 music streaming apps across colleges in the U.S. Twelve targeted campaigns for each tournament will cost between $15,000 and $20,000. (This is pricing before an official “MUSIC” sponsor for the tournament is solidified. After a partnership is formed, pricing for ads and live talent associated with the platform will be reduced tremendously if not eliminated completely.
Marketing $240,000 per year: We will be bringing on an in-house marketing team. As someone who has been involved in nationwide marketing campaigns, I am aware of the qualifications needed for the positions (see staff section for clarity). Our yearly marketing budget will breakdown as follows:
Test Campaigns: $2000 X 12 tournaments = $24,000
Influencer budget: $1,300 per month X 12 = $16,000
Ad-spend across SM platforms: $16,500 per month X 12 = $200,000
On course Marketing $200,000 per year: Our marketing budget will consist of our print marketing efforts. This includes signage, obstacle advertising, tee boxes, baskets etc. Because our sponsors are signing on for a minimum of 1 year, we will only have to create advertising one time for the season. These advertising pieces will be showcased at every tournament and only must be created one time and maintained from there on out. By utilizing personal resources that we have in print advertising, our budget will fall far below the average print project.

STAFF & ADMINISTRATION

Administration $554,000 per year: The salary positions for our administration staff are as follows:
Andrew Panza CEO: $120,000 per year
Alexander Smart CFO: $100,000 per year
Corey La Russo CMO: $120,000 per year
Distin Dinsmore CTO: $60,000 per year
Corp. Attorney: $60,000 per year retainer
Silent Investor: $24,000 per year
Additional Office Staff: $200,000 per year (3 office employees)
On-course Staff $: On course staff includes 3 main categories of people:
Construction Crew $72,000 per year: Our crew will consist of 6 members whose responsibility is to set up and take down the tour equipment. They will be flown in and out of the tournament locations ahead of the tournament and after the tournament is completed.
6 members X $200 per day = $1,200 per day x 5 days = $6,000 per tournament X 12 tournament = $72,000 per year
Interactive Center $7,200 per year: We will have 3 paid employees that operate the interactive center at each event. These employees will be paid for one day of work per event.
3 members X $200 per day = $600 per tournament X 12 tournaments = $7,200 per year
Food and Drink Centers $9,600 per year: We will have 2 food and drink centers on the course. These will mostly be filled by food trucks and local food options, but our sponsors will be represented at our locations. We will have 2 employees per location.
4 members X $200 per day = $800 per tournament X 12 tournaments = $9,600 per year
On-course Officials: The college disc golf team will be given the opportunity to walk the course with their favorite players as officials of the tournament. As players in the CDGL, they must be certified as officials to play in the league.
Corporate Office & Overhead $180,000: We will locate our corporate office in Southern California. With the major golf brands located here, we will have prime access to these brands as the sport grows.
$15,000 (rent & utilities) x 12 months = $180,000

Security: Provided by the college

Insurance

We will be targeting Amped Insurance. They are listed as one of the top sports insurance companies in the United States. They are active in many different sports categories and will make a great partner. An exact quote has not been provided by them, but we have market estimates between $40,000 - $80,000 per year for this type of sports tournament.

Equipment
Course Equipment $80,000: Course equipment will be limited to our obstacles. The obstacles will be made for easy assembly and disassembly with interchangeable marketing surfaces. These are simple supplies like wood, basic tools, foam, and paint. This is a high estimate for what materials will cost.

TRAVEL & ACCOMMODATION

Flights Provided by Players: We will be targeting a partnership with SouthWest Airlines. They are a partner of MGM Resorts and a big sponsor in the sports world. We will be requesting flight credits that our players and staff can utilize throughout the year as well as “A-List Preferred” status for players and administration staff.
Staff Flights $54,000: We will have to fly our event staff (non-volunteer staff) into each city the week of the tournament. We have 15 staff members max that will require this service. Using our partnership with a major airline, we are basing our projected amount on a flat rate flight price for each flight, using our credit to make up the remainder of the flight cost.
$300 per flight X 15 flights per month = $4500 per tournament X 12 tournaments = $54,000 per year.
Lodging Provided by players: We will be targeting MGM partner hotel groups for sponsorships. We will request players’ rooms for free in exchange for marketing during the players’ stay and upgrade considerations for all staff.
Staff Lodging $24,000 per year: With our construction crew utilizing the tour bus for their stay, we only need to consider rooms for our administration staff and paid event staff. This includes our interactive zone and retail center. We will also be exploring lodging credits from the hotel we chose to work with.
$400 per 3-night stay (average) x 5 rooms = $2000 per tournament X 12 tournaments = $24,000 per year
Tour Bus $150,000: The tour bus is a crucial part of our marketing campaigns on campus. By wrapping the tour bus in marketing and offering competitions and giveaways for students and fans who post pictures with the bus, we will recoup our investment in free marketing alone. This bus will also double as the command center for the event. Sleepers will allow our construction staff to have a place to lodge during setup and tear down. This also eliminates the need for additional staff lodging expenses for each tournament.

18-wheeler and Trailer $100,000 (FREE): Trailer and truck are incredibly easy to come by. After consulting with a 30-year truck driver, we can easily expect to acquire what we need for this price. However, TESLA is pushing their new tractor trailer line of vehicles more than ever right now. This could be an amazing opportunity to exchange nationwide marketing and recognition by donating our truck and trailer. We will be exploring this option heavily and Tesla is also scheduled for the release of their tour bus line as well. We will try and work deals on both vehicles.

PRIZES & AWARDS

Total Tournament Winnings for 1st season $4.2 million: Fli Golf is going to push the game of disc golf to new heights by offering the LARGEST PURSE IN HISTORY! $100,000 to the winning pair, but every single team that shows up and plays will leave with a check. Also, as a 1-day tournament instead of the average 3-day, players personal expenses are lowered with higher than ever financial possibilities. This will ensure that NO pro player will have a reason to skip our monthly tournaments. As an example, if a player shows up and wins ALL 12 tournaments this season, they will increase their yearly earnings $600,000. In this sport, this is unheard of.

Entertainment and Enhancements

Interactive Center $20,000: Our fan interactive center will be a multi-lane throwing range. There will be different levels of difficulty where players can test their skills for chances to win things like Team t-shirts, branded discs, autographed items or meet and greet tickets. This will be free to paying fans and will enhance our public view for families and fans alike who want reasons to come out. This will be constructed for easy setup and teardown and will consist mainly of Tier 1 marketing brands.

Live Performances $240,000: We are designating $20,000 per tournament to ensure we work with a large on-campus promoter and secure talent for the live performance that will draw a crowd. This can include bands, solo artists, DJ’s, comedians, celebrities, or combinations of these. Once our college list is complete, we will search out people within these groups who are college alums.

MERCHANDISE COSTS

Tournament Merchandise $100,00 per year: We will be ordering minimal inventory for tournament sales. Within the college age student community, limited edition or exclusive gear is all the rage. We will have a limited number of team merchandise available at each tournament. Our branded merchandise for the first year will be limited until we see which items sell/do not sell. This included all giveaway or prize merchandise for marketing, grab bags, and the interactive center.
Online Merchandise $0: For online sales, we will utilize a dropship company for production. Once we see merchandise sales reach a target level, we will begin to inventory our merchandise in-house. We do not project this during the first year of play.

TECHNOLOGY & COMMUNICATION

Camera Package $60,000 (for 3): Although the tournament will be covered by a sports network, we will have 3 FLI Golf camera men at each tournament. We will use volunteers from the college media program who are looking for experience and an opportunity to show their skills. We will give them footage credit on social media and provide them with copies for their professional resumes. Three complete packages will cost $20,000 a piece on the high end.

Short range communication system for staff $700: There are a lot of different options, however, a basic system with low visibility headgear will work fine for our tournament needs. These range between $350 and $1,000.
Custom Scoreboard $50,000 (for 2): After reviewing multiple score board options, custom scoreboards can be made for good prices. One main score board will be located by the first tee box and the other will be strategically located on the course (location will depend on each individual course).
Drone Cameras $10,000 (for 2): With drone technology we will be adding exciting coverage of each tournament to our in-house marketing efforts. Also, with our Fli Golf footage, we have copyright and leasing options.

MISCELLANEOUS

Miscellaneous Expenses $300,000: In any business venture we must be prepared for unforeseen expenses. This includes but is not limited to tour bus and trailer gas/maintenance, additional staffing needs, equipment rental, and additional travel or lodging expenses.
