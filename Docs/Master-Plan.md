BUDGET BREAKDOWN

Sponsorships:

Major Sponsors $6,000,000: 2 PER SEASON/$3,000,000 PER
SPONSOR- INCLUDED IN ALL TOURNAMENT RELATED ADVERTISING
MATERIAL INCLUDING RADIO, PRINT, WEBISTE, AND SOCIAL MEDIA.
EACH ACQUIRE 30% OF AVAILABLE MAJOR ON-SITE MARKETING
SPACE. THIS INCLUDES TEE BOXES, BASKETS, AND ON-COURSE
OBJECTS. TARGET COMPANY GENRES - SPORTSBOOKS AND FINANCIAL
INSTITUTIONS.

BETMGM (Major sportsbook sponsors): *1st option
 Takes ALL action on the tournaments. By targeting colleges that
already have athletic department ties to BETMGM we will have
full access to the home course and college grounds staff/disc golf
clubs. This tour will further solidify the relationship between
BETMGM and the college. This sponsorship will also solidify the
sportsbook as the undisputed leader in the United States Disc Golf
gambling world.

FANDUEL: *2ND option
 FanDuel is a leader in sports gambling with college students. They
are established in IVY League sports college and staple college
games such as corn hole. After their acquisition of TVG, their
desperation to expand into new sports and college athletics
makes them a primed and ready 2nd option for our tour.

22

Cash-app/Venmo (Financial Sponsors): *1st option
 We are looking for a major financial sponsor that has a strong
foothold within the college demographic. Easy cash transfer apps
have become the major way for college students to exchange
money for day-to-day purchases. By offering one of these
institutions a chance to enhance their marketing on IVY League
school campuses, they will jump at the opportunity. We can also
offer discounts for fans who use one of these companies to
purchase tickets and merchandise. This is a marketing opportunity
they cannot pass on.

Major financial institution: *2nd option
 If we cannot find a cash transfer company who sees the
opportunity, we will target financial institutions that are
established in the IVY League college community. This is the low
hanging fruit in our opinion and will be an easy avenue as a
secondary option. Examples would be PayPal or ApplePay

23
TIER 1 SPONSORS $6,000,000: 4 PER SEASON/$1,500,000 PER SEASON
- INCLUDED IN TOURNAMENT RELATED ADVERTISING MATERIAL
INCLUDING RADIO, PRINT, AND SOCIAL MEDIA. EACH ACQUIRE 10%
OF AVAILABLE MAJOR MARKETING SPACE. THIS INCLUDES TEE BOXES,
BASKETS, AND ON-COURSE OBJECTS. TARGET COMPANY GENRES - 2
INTERNATINAL DISC GOLF BRANDS AND 2 U.S BASED BRANDS.

Dynamic Discs (Major U.S based disc golf brands):
 Dynamic Disc is the 3rd largest U.S based disc golf brand. They
sponsor almost every major disc golf tournament in the world. We
are targeting them because they represent The Trilogy which
includes Dynamic Discs, Westside Discs, and Latitude 64. These
are some of the largest disc golf brands in the world. This
sponsorship allows all their brands to heavily influence the next
generation of competitive disc golf players in every major D.G
country.

MVP DISC SPORTS
 MVP Disc Sports is the 4th largest U.S based disc golf brand. They
have a lower sponsorship presence in the U.S than they do
internationally. This is due to their prime international
tournament presence with their sister brand. FLI GOLF TOUR is an
opportunity to advance their position with the college disc golf
community, who represent the major numbers in yearly
registered rounds of D.G played.

24

Latitude 64 (Major International based Disc Golf Brands):
 As one of the major brands in The Trilogy group, they are based in
one of the largest disc golf countries in the world, SWEEDEN. They
are a huge presence in the European professional disc golf scene.
An opportunity to sponsor a professional tournament on the
highest academic campuses in America, nationally televised, is not
something they will be able to turn down.

Axiom Discs:
 Axiom Discs are known in the disc golf industry as the FLASHY
DISCS! They have vibrant artwork and futuristic styles that attract
the &quot;Higher Class&quot; disc golfer. With our tournaments being held at
IVY League schools, this is a brand that will attract the higher end
disc golf shopper and/or player. Although they are owned by MVP
Disc Sports in Michigan, they have major influence in disc golf
around the world.

25
TIER 2 SPONSORS $1,200,000: 4 PER SEASON/$300,00,000 PER
SEASON PLUS SUPPLIES - INCLUDED IN ALL FOOD AND BEVERAGE
RELATED ADVERTISING MATERIAL INCLUDING RADIO, PRINT,
WEBISTE, AND SOCIAL MEDIA. EACH ACQUIRE 25% OF AVAILABLE
MAJOR MARKETING SPACE. THIS INCLUDES FOOD COURT SPACE,
FOOD AND DRINK STATIONS, AND PLAYER/FAN GIVEAWAYS AND
GIFTBASKETS. TARGET COMPANY GENRES - FOOD AND BEVERAGE

COMPANIES.

Mananalu Pure Water (Non-Plastic Water Company Founded by Jason
Mamoa): *1st water choice
 As one of the largest celebrities in the world, Jason Mamoa has
founded a water company that prides itself on providing purified
water that is supplied in non-plastic and reusable containers. This
marketing angle plays directly into the foundations of disc golf
which is to enjoy and preserve the amazing landscape our great
country provides us. This sponsorship is a highway into the IVE
League college athletic scene for their brand.

PepsiCO: (Beverage company that can supply vast amount of
beverage options): *1st beverage choice
 As a partner of MGM Resorts, PepsiCo is an obvious target for FLI
Disc Golf. Also, as the second largest sponsor of professional
sports tournaments in the U.S, they will be more than ready to
enter the progressive Disc Golf market. With alcohol brand ties,
they can also be a potential alcohol or second water option
sponsor for the tour.

26
Anheuser-Busch (top 3 alcohol distributor in the U.S): *1st choice
 As a partner of MGM Resorts and top choice of legal age college
students around the country, this is the obvious alcohol brand to
choose for the FLI Golf tour. Their vast network of distribution
options is perfect for our outdoor tour.

Five Guys (Top 5 fast food chain on college campuses): *1st choice
 With a handheld food menu and rural America approved larger
than normal portions, Five Guys has American fan favorites like
custom hot-dogs and burgers. With the addition of local food
truck menus, this staple in the college food community will be a
perfect fit for FLI Golf.

27
TIER 3 SPONSORS $800,000: 10 PER SEASON/$80,000 PER SEASON -
INCLUDED IN ALL TOURNAMENT GIFT BASKETS. EACH ARE REQUIRED
TO SUBMIT 1 ITEM FOR FANS AND 1 ITEM FOR PLAYERS/VIP&#39;S. THIS
INCLUDES FAN GIFT BAGS (LIMITED NUMBER PER TOURNAMENT),
PLAYER GIFT BASKETS (LIMITED NUMBER PER TOURNAMENT), AND
VIP GUEST BASKETS (LIMITED NUMBER PER TOURNAMENT). TARGET
COMPANY GENRES - RETAIL BRANDS, CLOTHING BRANDS, FOOD
GROUPS, RIDE-SHARE COMPANIES, FOOD DELIVERY COMPANIES,

STREAMING APPS, ECT...

Company Examples:
 North Face, LL Bean, GNC, Fast Food chains, Dick&#39;s Sporting
Goods, Cliff Bar, Uber, Lyft, Uber Eats, Doordash, BBAB, Dollar
General, Walmart, Wayfaire, Apple Music, Iheart Radio, Gillette,
CLEAR, Samsonite, Amazon, Netflix, YoutubeTV, Peacock, ect..

28
Merchandise Sales: *All numbers are based on low-end annual

projections*

 Tournament Sales $48,000: Average $8 profit per sale multiplied
by an average of 500 sales per tournament. This number is then
multiplied by 12 tournaments per season. Our strategy is to focus
on limited edition college collab logos and designs for clothing and
equipment collections at each tournament to ensure 100%
merchandise sell-out.
$8 x 500 = $4,000 / $4,000 x 12 tournaments = $48,000
 Online Sales $100,000: With limited time available during the
tournament for merchandise sales, our expectation is to double
the tournament sales number throughout the year through our
online platforms including our website, social media, and partner
retail locations.
Ticket Sales: *All ticket sales are based on annual low-end

projections*

 General Admission $120,000: A minimum of 1000 general
admission tickets sold per tournament at a price of $10 per ticket.
General admission tickets qualify for &quot;FIRST 500&quot;.
$10 x 1000 = $10,000 / $10,000 x 12 tournaments = $120,000
 VIP Tickets $120,000: These tickets are limited in number and
allow access to the closest tee box, basket, and obstacle areas.
They will also be provided with a coupon for 50% OFF ANY TEAM
SHIRT from our on-site store. VIP Tickets qualify for &quot;FIRST 500&quot;
also.
$20 x $500 = $10,000 / $10,000 x 12 tournaments = $120,000

29

EXPENSES

COURSE RENTAL AND MAINTAINANCE

 Landscaping $100,000 per year: The truly great benefit to the
game of Disc Golf is that is takes place in the great American
outdoors, making landscaping needs almost non-existent.
Minimum materials will be needed on-hand to decorate a course.
We will be using fake and reusable items so upfront and ongoing
costs will remain as low as possible. Also, by hosting the
tournaments on a college campus that competes in the CDGL
(College Disc Golf League), they will have a campus course or
home course nearby we can utilize for free. Materials we will keep
on hand are items including multiple sizes of fake trees, fake
bushes, fake vines, large foam rocks/boulders, netting, fake hay
bales, and wood chips.

30

MARKETING &amp; PROMOTION

 Advertising $200,000 per year: Music streaming apps will be the
leader in our advertising efforts. We will be using targeted Spotify
and Apple Music ads for the build-up of each tournament. By
targeting the college campus and surrounding city environments,
we will capture both the disc gold music lovers and the local
music audience who will be happy to hear of a live show at the
end of the tournament. These are the top 2 music streaming apps
across colleges in the U.S. Twelve targeted campaigns for each
tournament will cost between $15,000 and $20,000. (This is
pricing before an official “MUSIC” sponsor for the tournament is
solidified. After a partnership is formed, pricing for ads and live
talent associated with the platform will be reduced tremendously
if not eliminated completely.
 Marketing $240,000 per year: We will be bringing on an in-house
marketing team. As someone who has been involved in
nationwide marketing campaigns, I am aware of the qualifications
needed for the positions (see staff section for clarity). Our yearly
marketing budget will breakdown as follows:
Test Campaigns: $2000 X 12 tournaments = $24,000
Influencer budget: $1,300 per month X 12 = $16,000
Ad-spend across SM platforms: $16,500 per month X 12 = $200,000
 On course Marketing $200,000 per year: Our marketing budget
will consist of our print marketing efforts. This includes signage,
obstacle advertising, tee boxes, baskets etc. Because our sponsors
are signing on for a minimum of 1 year, we will only have to
create advertising one time for the season. These advertising

31
pieces will be showcased at every tournament and only must be
created one time and maintained from there on out. By utilizing
personal resources that we have in print advertising, our budget
will fall far below the average print project.

STAFF &amp; ADMINISTRATION

 Administration $554,000 per year: The salary positions for our
administration staff are as follows:
Andrew Panza CEO: $120,000 per year
Alexander Smart CFO: $100,000 per year
Corey La Russo CMO: $120,000 per year
Distin Dinsmore CTO: $60,000 per year
Andrew Ivchenko Corp. Attorney: $60,000 per year retainer
Silent Investor: $24,000 per year
Additional Office Staff: $200,000 per year (3 office employees)
 On-course Staff $: On course staff includes 3 main categories of
people:
Construction Crew $72,000 per year: Our crew will consist of 6
members whose responsibility is to set up and take down the tour
equipment. They will be flown in and out of the tournament locations
ahead of the tournament and after the tournament is completed.

32
6 members X $200 per day = $1,200 per day x 5 days = $6,000 per
tournament X 12 tournament = $72,000 per year
Interactive Center $7,200 per year: We will have 3 paid employees that
operate the interactive center at each event. These employees will be
paid for one day of work per event.
3 members X $200 per day = $600 per tournament X 12 tournaments =
$7,200 per year
Food and Drink Centers $9,600 per year: We will have 2 food and drink
centers on the course. These will mostly be filled by food trucks and
local food options, but our sponsors will be represented at our
locations. We will have 2 employees per location.
4 members X $200 per day = $800 per tournament X 12 tournaments =
$9,600 per year
On-course Officials: The college disc golf team will be given the
opportunity to walk the course with their favorite players as officials of
the tournament. As players in the CDGL, they must be certified as
officials to play in the league.
Security: Provided by the college

33

Insurance

 We will be targeting Amped Insurance. They are listed as one of
the top sports insurance companies in the United States. They are
active in many different sports categories and will make a great
partner. An exact quote has not been provided by them, but we
have market estimates between $40,000 - $80,000 per year for
this type of sports tournament.

Equipment

 Course Equipment $80,000: Course equipment will be limited to
our obstacles. The obstacles will be made for easy assembly and
disassembly with interchangeable marketing surfaces. These are
simple supplies like wood, basic tools, foam, and paint. This is a
high estimate for what materials will cost.

34

TRAVEL &amp; ACCOMMONDATION

 Flights Provided by Players: We will be targeting a partnership
with SouthWest Airlines. They are a partner of MGM Resorts and
a big sponsor in the sports world. We will be requesting flight
credits that our players and staff can utilize throughout the year
as well as “A-List Preferred” status for players and administration
staff.
 Staff Flights $54,000: We will have to fly our event staff (non-
volunteer staff) into each city the week of the tournament. We
have 15 staff members max that will require this service. Using
our partnership with a major airline, we are basing our projected
amount on a flat rate flight price for each flight, using our credit
to make up the remainder of the flight cost.
$300 per flight X 15 flights per month = $4500 per tournament X
12 tournaments = $54,000 per year.
 Lodging Provided by players: We will be targeting MGM partner
hotel groups for sponsorships. We will request players’ rooms for
free in exchange for marketing during the players’ stay and
upgrade considerations for all staff.
 Staff Lodging $24,000 per year: With our construction crew
utilizing the tour bus for their stay, we only need to consider
rooms for our administration staff and paid event staff. This
includes our interactive zone and retail center. We will also be
exploring lodging credits from the hotel we chose to work with.
$400 per 3 night stay (average) x 5 rooms = $2000 per
tournament X 12 tournaments = $24,000 per year

35
 Tour Bus $150,000: The tour bus is a crucial part of our marketing
campaigns on campus. By wrapping the tour bus in marketing and
offering competitions and giveaways for students and fans who
post pictures with the bus, we will recoup our investment in free
marketing alone. This bus will also double as the command center
for the event. Sleepers will allow our construction staff to have a
place to lodge during setup and tear down. This also eliminates
the need for additional staff lodging expenses for each
tournament.

 18-wheeler and Trailer $100,000 (FREE): Trailer and truck are
incredibly easy to come by. After consulting with a 30-year truck
driver, we can easily expect to acquire what we need for this
price. However, TESLA is pushing their new tractor trailer line of
vehicles more than ever right now. This could be an amazing
opportunity to exchange nationwide marketing and recognition
by donating our truck and trailer. We will be exploring this option
heavily and Tesla is also scheduled for the release of their tour
bus line as well. We will try and work deals on both vehicles.

PRIZES &amp; AWARDS

 Total Tournament Winings for 1 st season $4.2 million: Fli Golf is
going to push the game of disc golf to new heights by offering the
LARGEST PURSE IN HISTORY! $100,000 to the winning pair, but
every single team that shows up and plays will leave with a check.
Also, as a 1-day tournament instead of the average 3-day, players
personal expenses are lowered with higher than ever financial
possibilities. This will ensure that NO pro player will have a reason
to skip our monthly tournaments. As an example, if a player
shows up and wins ALL 12 tournaments this season, they will
increase their yearly earnings $600,000. In this sport, this is
unheard of.

Entertainment and Enhancements

 Interactive Center $20,000: Our fan interactive center will be a
multi-lane throwing range. There will be different levels of
difficulty where players can test their skills for chances to win
things like Team t-shirts, branded discs, autographed items or
meet and greet tickets. This will be free to paying fans and will
enhance our public view for families and fans alike who want
reasons to come out. This will be constructed for easy setup and
teardown and will consist mainly of Tier 1 marketing brands.

37
 Live Performances $240,000: We are designating $20,000 per
tournament to ensure we work with a large on-campus promoter
and secure talent for the live performance that will draw a crowd.
This can include bands, solo artists, DJ’s, comedians, celebrities, or
combinations of these. Once our college list is complete, we will
search out people within these groups who are college alums.

MERCHANDISE COSTS

 Tournament Merchandise $100,00 per year: We will be ordering
minimal inventory for tournament sales. Within the college age
student community, limited edition or exclusive gear is all the
rage. We will have a limited number of team merchandise
available at each tournament. Our branded merchandise for the
first year will be limited until we see which items sell/do not sell.
This included all giveaway or prize merchandise for marketing,
grab bags, and the interactive center.
 Online Merchandise $0: For online sales, we will utilize a dropship
company for production. Once we see merchandise sales reach a
target level, we will begin to inventory our merchandise in-house.
We do not project this during the first year of play.

38

TECHNOLOGY &amp; COMMUNICATION

 Camera Package $60,000 (for 3): Although the tournament will be
covered by a sports network, we will have 3 FLI Golf camera men
at each tournament. We will use volunteers from the college
media program who are looking for experience and an
opportunity to show their skills. We will give them footage credit
on social media and provide them with copies for their
professional resumes. Three complete packages will cost $20,000
a piece on the high end.

 Short range communication system for staff $700: There are a lot
of different options, however, a basic system with low visibility
headgear will work fine for our tournament needs. These range
between $350 and $1,000.
 Custom Score Board $50,000 (for 2): After reviewing multiple
score board options, custom score boards can be made for good
prices. One main score board will be located by the first tee box
and the other will be strategically located on the course (location
will depend on each individual course).
 Drone Cameras $10,000 (for 2): With drone technology we will be
adding exciting coverage of each tournament to our in-house
marketing efforts. Also, with our Fli Golf footage, we have
copywrite and leasing options.

39

MISCELLANOUS

 Miscellaneous Expenses $300,000: In any business venture we
must be prepared for unforeseen expenses. This includes but is
not limited to tour bus and trailer gas/maintenance, additional
staffing needs, equipment rental, and additional travel or lodging
expenses.

Alexander Smart - Chief Financial Officer

Alexander Smart joined the Marine Corps in July 1980 and was honorably
discharged in August 1991. Every rank Mr. Smart attained, from E-2/PFC to E-
6/SSGT, was through meritorious promotion, which is an accelerated promotion
based solely on performance. When entering the business world, Mr. Smart
recognized that the highest paid employees were the people who drove
company revenues. He thus started his 31- year career of stellar performance in
sales and management.

46
 As the VP of sales for INFO 4 CARS, Mr. Smart helped earn an exclusive contract
with Walmart and Sam’s Club. This program generated revenues in excess of $5
million per year through “Private Lot Events” across the nation. Mr. Smart
began to further develop his sales and marketing talents as the National Sales
Director for an upstart independent yellow pages company called Yellow
Directory Fast Pages. Taking the helm, he hired, trained, assisted, and motivated
sales reps in achieving over $250,000 in sales in just eight months. Determined
to maximize his success, in January of 2005 he stepped out on his own to launch
“Your Community Yellow Pages and Community Discount Magazine.” His daily
focus on hiring, training, and motivating the sales force resulted in sales of $1.5
Million in 2005, $3 Million in 2006, and $3.2 Million in 2007. His remarkable
success with this company caught the attention of The Yellow Pages and
negotiations began for a multi-million-dollar buyout of the company.
Based on his experience as a sales manager for MCI, Sprint and Broadwing
Communications, major companies in telecommunications industry, Mr. Smart
saw the direction that online internet marketing was going and decided that the
most secure path to continued sustained growth was in the recession-proof
telecommunications industry. He mobilized his talents and entered the telecom
arena, generating over $1.8 million in revenue in 2008 – 2009. Mr. Smart then
transitioned to cellular, utilizing small independent stores nationwide to sell
products and services. The company was able to sell the brand’s customer base
within three (3) years.

Dustin Dinsmore - Chief Technical Officer

With a driving passion for innovation, I have carved a niche in the automotive
industry, particularly in the realm of gift and loyalty card services. One of my

This not only replaced a manual process but has consistently empowered
dealers with readily accessible, actionable daily insights, culminating in
significant cost reductions and streamlined operations.

As both an entrepreneur and developer, my mantra has always been solution
oriented. Every challenge I encounter is met with a customized application
designed to efficiently address the issue at hand. This proactive approach,
rooted in simplicity, has been evident in the seamless adoption of our system by
auto dealership service advisors. Their positive feedback is a testament to the
effectiveness and user-centric nature of our solutions.
For more than a decade, I&#39;ve delved deep into technology, coding an array of
diverse projects. As the horizons of our vision widen, my excitement grows in
anticipation of introducing groundbreaking innovations. This is particularly true
as we chart our disc golf journey, meticulously tracking and monitoring each
step.
Currently, I am at the helm of building and conceptualizing Fligolf.com and am
also delving into the vast possibilities of Web 3 technologies, exploring how it
could be integrated into our existing systems.
Personal Interests: My downtime often finds me on the golf course or behind a screen,
coding and bringing ideas to life.
In the nexus of technology and innovation, I stand committed to crafting solutions that
not only meet immediate needs but also shape the future. My professional journey is
guided by an unwavering mission to blend simplicity with efficiency, ensuring every
venture is a step toward progress.
