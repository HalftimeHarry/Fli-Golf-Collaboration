Over 500 million people live within
6 mile of a disc golf course. 4.3 new
disc golf courses are built every
single day.
• 15 pro players have signed 6 figure
sponsorship deals, and 1 player has
signed a 7-figure deal. This shows
the money is starting to make its
way into the sport.
• There are over 9,400 professional
tournaments held in the U.S each
year. By accessing network levels
not yet achieved by the PDGA, we
will easily form partnerships with
the governing bodies and brands in
the game.
• There are almost the exact same
amount of disc golf courses as there
are pickle ball facilities in the US.
Out of the two, disc golf is the more

accessible to all ages and cost-
effective sport.

• With our 3-phase buildout of the
tour, we will capture the entire disc
golf community world-wide, as well
as sports fans who will be
introduced to the sport for the 1st
time on national television. This will
also open us up to big sports book
partnerships and advertising
possibilities.
• FLI GOLF FANTASY will be a guiding
light for sportsbook partners. We
have built the live scoring system to
make setting lines and offering
gambling opportunities as easy as
possible. Fantasy is the #1 played
game by gamblers in sports today.
