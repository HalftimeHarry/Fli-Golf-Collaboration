Introduction
The PDGA Competition Manual for Disc Golf Events outlines the procedures and guidelines for PDGA events. This manual is to be used alongside the Official Rules of Disc Golf and the Tour Standards document. These procedures and guidelines are mandatory for all PDGA-sanctioned events unless mentioned otherwise. Some exceptions are made for events in countries outside the United States and Canada, which are detailed in the International Program Guide. All references in the Competition Manual or Tour Standards to a "Tournament Director" or "TD" denote the individual overseeing the event as per section 801.02.G. Tournament Directors who find any provision in these documents unsuitable can apply for a waiver by reaching out to the PDGA Director of Event Support via email at eventsupport@pdga.com or phone at 762-253-2200.

The Spirit of the Game
Disc golf usually takes place without a referee or umpire overseeing the game. The essence of the game relies on players demonstrating sportsmanship, integrity, respect for fellow players, and adherence to the Official Rules of Disc Golf. Players are expected to maintain a disciplined demeanor, showcasing courtesy and sportsmanship always, regardless of their competitive spirit.

The philosophy behind disc golf can be summarized as: "Make the call. Accept the call. It’s not about personalities; it's about the rules."
