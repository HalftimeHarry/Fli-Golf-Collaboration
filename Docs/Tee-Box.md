# Custom Disc Golf Tee Box Construction Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines the steps to build, assemble, disassemble, and manage a portable 8'x12'x3' disc golf tee box with artificial turf and advertising space. Designed for easy transportation, the tee box can be assembled at various locations for events and disassembled for mobility.

## Materials Needed

- **Frame Materials:**
  - (8) 12-foot 2x4 lumber for the base and top frame
  - (12) 3-foot 2x4 lumber for the vertical supports
  - (4) 8-foot 2x4 lumber for the side supports
- **Joining Materials:**
  - Wood screws (3-inch)
  - Hinges (to allow for folding parts for easier transport)
  - Metal brackets for added stability
- **Surface Materials:**
  - Artificial turf (preferably in a roll for easy deployment and storage)
  - Velcro strips (to attach and detach the turf from the frame securely)
- **Advertising Materials:**
  - Banners or removable signs
  - Adhesive Velcro or double-sided tape for attaching advertisements
- **Tools:**
  - Saw (for cutting lumber to required lengths)
  - Screwdriver or power drill
  - Measuring tape
  - Level
  - Utility knife (for cutting artificial turf)

## Construction Steps

### Frame Assembly

1. **Build the Base and Top Frames:**
   - Arrange (4) 12-foot 2x4s and (2) 8-foot 2x4s to create two rectangles (8'x12') for the base and top of the tee box.
   - Secure the corners with wood screws and metal brackets for added stability.

2. **Attach Vertical Supports:**
   - Evenly space and attach the 3-foot 2x4s vertically between the base and top frames to create the sides of the tee box.
   - Ensure each vertical support is level and secured with screws.

3. **Install Hinges (Optional):**
   - For easier transport, install hinges on two of the 12-foot sides, allowing the frame to fold in half.

### Surface Attachment

4. **Prepare Artificial Turf:**
   - Measure and cut the artificial turf to fit the 8'x12' top surface of the tee box.
   - Attach Velcro strips to the underside of the turf and the top frame of the tee box for easy removal and attachment.

### Advertising Space

5. **Install Advertising:**
   - Attach Velcro or double-sided tape to the back of banners or signs.
   - Secure advertisements to the sides of the tee box, ensuring they are visible and stable.

## Assembly and Disassembly for Transport

- **Assembly:**
  - If hinged, unfold the frame and secure any loose joints.
  - Attach the artificial turf to the top of the tee box using the Velcro strips.
  - Add advertising materials to the designated spaces.

- **Disassembly:**
  - Remove advertisements and carefully peel off the artificial turf.
  - Fold the frame along the hinges (if installed) or dismantle the frame by unscrewing the vertical supports.
  - Roll the turf and store all materials in a transportable manner.

## Maintenance and Storage

- **Artificial Turf Care:**
  - Brush and clean the turf regularly to maintain its appearance and remove debris.
  - Store the turf rolled up, avoiding sharp folds to prevent creases.

- **Frame Care:**
  - Check and tighten any loose screws or brackets periodically.
  - Store in a dry place to prevent wood rot or metal corrosion.

## Notes

- Customize the size of the tee box or the type of artificial turf based on specific league requirements or preferences.
- Always ensure the tee box is stable and level before use to prevent accidents.

This guide provides a basic framework for constructing a portable disc golf tee box. Adaptations may be required based on specific needs or available materials.

Creating a detailed blueprint for a custom disc golf tee box, including all sides, top, bottom, and information on turf attachment, can be complex. Below, I'll outline a simplified version of such a blueprint in text form, which can guide you or a professional in drafting a more detailed, to-scale drawing.

Blueprint Overview
This blueprint outlines the design for an 8 feet wide, 12 feet long, and 3 feet tall portable disc golf tee box. The design includes a foldable wooden frame for easy assembly and disassembly, covered with removable artificial turf for playing.

Frame Design
Base and Top Frames:

Constructed using 2x4 lumber.
Each rectangle frame (base and top) measures 8 feet by 12 feet.
Corners are secured with wood screws and reinforced with metal brackets for stability.
Vertical Supports:

Twelve 3-foot 2x4s serve as vertical supports, connecting the base and top frames.
Supports are evenly spaced along the length of the tee box for structural integrity.
Side Supports:

Four 8-foot 2x4s are used as side supports along the width, enhancing lateral stability.
Hinges for Folding
Hinges are installed on two of the 12-foot sides of the top frame, allowing the structure to fold in half for transport.
Turf Attachment
Artificial Turf:

Cut to a size of 8 feet by 12 feet to fit the top frame.
The underside of the turf is equipped with Velcro strips.
Frame Top Surface:

The corresponding Velcro strips are attached to the top edge of the frame.
This design allows for easy attachment and removal of the turf.
Assembly Instructions
Frame Construction:
Assemble the base and
top frames using 2x4 lumber according to the specified dimensions. Secure corners with screws and metal brackets.

Vertical and Side Supports:

Attach the 3-foot vertical supports between the base and top frames at regular intervals for support. Add the 8-foot side supports on the width sides for additional stability.
Folding Mechanism:

Install hinges along two of the 12-foot sides of the top frame to allow the structure to fold.
Turf Preparation and Attachment:

Lay out the artificial turf and attach Velcro strips to its underside. Align and secure the turf on the top frame of the tee box, ensuring a tight and even fit.
Blueprint Diagrams

2. Side View:

Illustrates the height of the vertical supports and the positioning of side supports for lateral stability.
3. End View:

Depicts the end of the tee box, showing the thickness of the base and top frames, and the arrangement of vertical supports.
4. Bottom View:

Details the construction of the base frame and the placement of metal brackets for reinforcement.
5. Folded View for Transport:

Demonstrates how the tee box folds along the hinges for ease of transport.
Additional Notes
Ensure all wood is treated or sealed for outdoor use to prevent weather damage.
Regularly inspect the frame and turf for wear and tear, especially the hinges and Velcro, to ensure safety and durability.
Consider the weight of the structure for transport and assembly needs; it may require multiple people to safely move and set up.
Detailed Drawings
For a professional blueprint with precise measurements and detailed drawings, it's recommended to consult with a carpenter or an engineer. They can take this overview and create detailed, to-scale blueprints suitable for construction, ensuring all safety and structural integrity standards are met.
