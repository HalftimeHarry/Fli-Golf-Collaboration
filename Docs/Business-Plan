Introduction & Executive Summary:

FLI Golf. (the “Company” or "FLI Golf League"), is a California C corporation formed in 2022. FLI Golf is launching an innovative live disc golf experience, changing the way sports fans view this amazing sport forever. FLI Golf will focus on offering both live and fantasy disc golf tournaments that will showcase both talent and sponsors alike. 

Disc Golf is one of the most played recreational sports in the world and ranks amongst the fastest growing sports worldwide. Why haven’t we seen disc golf on the main sports stages if it is this popular? The answer is simple, tournament layout. FLI Golf will bring disc golf and its athletes out of the woods and place them into a custom-built course that will push the boundaries of the game as well as create a fan experience like no other. By focusing on disc manipulation and accuracy, our field of play can be shortened, which will increase the fan experience and sponsorship opportunities. Together, this will make FLI Golf the preferred fan experience in the sport of disc golf. 

The management team of FLI Golf has years of experience in the sports, entertainment, and business management industries, which has allowed the company to secure a major production partner, ensuring live play media coverage. This provides the players, fans and sponsors with the assurance that the event will be showcased worldwide. This elevation will provide the financial success everyone is looking for. 

FLI Golf has identified several groups as viable market segments. Each group can be clearly defined and approached with targeted marketing. Although the top states for disc golf are spread around the country – the overall player and fan demographics do not vary much at all. There will be overlaps between the different segments and potential tie-in opportunities as well. In keeping with the overall message of FLI Golf the marketing must always stress the new course format, gender equality, and live production/entertainment. The branding will be strong and focused.

FLI Golf has chosen to launch into the specific segments designated as high disc golf areas around the U.S, however the company is still looking at opportunities to penetrate other defined segments. FLI Golf will seek to increase fan interaction with the sports through bringing in celebrity guests, professional athlete guests, live music acts, and interactive options for tournament goers. The company will provide an attractive experience for the top world players to ensure their participation. With perks like large one-day payouts, new sponsorship opportunities, and professional level production, we will because the face of the sports these players will be proud to represent. FLI Golf will deliver a disc golf experience like never before, for everyone involved.

The company will, through strategic sports marketing partnerships, become the leading brand in the game and will quickly become the must-have brand in disc golf. The company will effectively transform the way the game is played, setting it above other 4-day, low-paying tournaments that currently exist as the norm. This new format and brand, if marketed correctly, allow the company to obtain the driver’s seat on the disc golf bus towards possibilities like Olympic play.
The past few years have seen a dramatic increase in recreational sport growth around the world. This is proven true with the success of sports like pickleball and professional cornhole. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected every segment of society; however, disc golf saw a tremendous increase in popularity and growth. Quarantine during the pandemic has increased the amount of people looking for competitive sports options that can be played in safe park environments. Disc golf allowed them to maintain physical fitness, interact with small groups in public, and maintain a sense of comradery while the world was experiencing separation. It also sparked a huge insurgency of new, committed players and fans.

FLI Golf has an opportunity to be one of the first disc golf leagues to bring in major sports sponsors and brands. Because of the commitment to showcasing our sponsor partners, the tournaments are set to bring fresh brand revenue into the sport. Additional disc golf leagues in the market will help to increase sport awareness and drive overall sales within the industry. Due to the short-term opportunity to grab a foothold in this sport, FLI Golf is aggressively rolling out the first tournament in 2025. As viewership demand increases, the innovative FLI Golf sales management strategy will allow the company to take advantage of all opportunities in media and advertising contracts. We estimate that by year three (Phase 3), the opportunity or "gold-rush" in our target market will be fully absorbed by FLI Golf.

It is the goal of management to position the company as an acquisition target for a sports group or financial group looking to gain market share and build a larger national sports brand by the end of year three. Most sports have hit growth plateaus in revenue and margins. After capturing the disc golf community worldwide and establishing our proprietary course tracking technology in year 3, we will have fully established FLI Golf’s value. If the business plan is executed as described and all milestones are met on time, management will be in a good position to sell the company. The most likely aggregators will be the same ownership groups that are picking up market shares in other major rec. sports. 

FLI Golf is now seeking a Title partner and Season 1 host. With the title partner revenue and venue secured the company will be able to finalize the buildout of Season 1 and finalize the contracts between sponsors, partners, players, and advertisers. FLI Golf management is also willing to entertain 2- or 3-year Title partnership commitments.  

History & Background:

FLI Golf was founded by Andrew Panza (Chief Executive Officer), Dustin Dinsmore (Chief Technical Officer), Corey La Russo (Chief Marketing Officer), and Alexander Smart (Chief Financial Officer). Having spent decades in successful careers spanning sports, broadcasting, business management, software creation, and staff management, our team is poised and ready to lead this tour and sport into the future. With our in-depth understanding of the current disc golf community and the largest impediments that the sport and its current governing bodies are facing, we can create an environment where these issues are overcome, and exciting new opportunities arise. With player frustration and organization within the current state-side and international disc golf organizations, our game plan to create a new opportunity within the sport instead of a competing league, we will remain open to partnerships with these pre-established entities. Our team is prepared with the right mix of experience and energy to execute on a clearly defined strategy. FLI Golf will focus on fan experience, elevating player status and viewership, showcasing partner brands with our custom course designs.

The founders have over 2 years of disc golf market. They have analyzed the business models of many successful and unsuccessful disc golf leagues and tournaments and are utilizing the knowledge to ensure that FLI Golf will steer a clear course. The founders have established a significant network and technical knowledge that allow the company to quickly capture market share. FLI Golf has identified and recruited potential hires with sports expertise as well as in-depth marketing knowledge and branding expertise.

FLI Golf’s Competitive Advantage 

FLI Golf has established relationships with a major sports production company, allowing the company to provide an attractive and relevant showcase of our tournaments. The company can offer players and sponsors a chance to reach new markets of fans through streaming or live airtime. With our enhanced viewership experience, we are the top selection for prime-time slots. With our production partners’ pre-established relationships with both major sports networks such as Fox Sports and brands like FanDuel, these contracts are all but solidified.  

Custom course design will be the key to multiple facets of our tournaments. Not only will it be the key to showcasing our advertising partners and sponsors, but it will also be the key to showcasing the many talents that the professional athletes of disc golf possess. Why have you only seen hole-in-ones in disc golf highlighted on top 10 plays? Because the courses aren’t designed to bring out great sports moments and show what is possible to accomplish with a disc. Also, by making every shot thrown a strategic decision between male and female team partners, the field of play can be dramatically smaller than a normal course layout. Room for error will be minimal. These courses also play a vital role in the live fan experience.

The FLI Golf fan experience is broken down into two parts, live and digital. The live experience starts with the fans’ ability to view the field of play. By focusing observation areas in locations where multiple high intense moments are happening on different holes, their motivation to travel throughout the course will be elevated. Food and drink stations, retail shopping experiences, and live music throughout the tournament will uphold the constant fan entertainment options. Also, our smaller course design creates more personal and memorable moments between players and fans, which is a major movement across all sports right now.

The second part of the fan experience in our Fantasy League. Fans can gather 5 of their friends and battle head-to-head each tournament with their dream team of disc golf pros. Choose either individual player format or select to play FLI Golf Team style and pick your favorite FLI Golf teams instead. This is not just an additional revenue stream for the league, but it also serves as an additional advertising platform and marketing opportunity for our title partner through giveaways and prize packages to league winners. Fantasy is currently the #1 app played sports game in the world and we will bring disc golf into the fold. 

With FLI Golf’s commitment to gender equality we will be a top selection for sponsorships and advertisers. Male and female players have an equal scoring system and will play for the same tee boxes. We are seeing this take main stage with the addition of Flag Football to the Olympic sports line-up. A version of a popular sport being showcased due to its ability to encourage players of any gender, race, or sexual preference. Equality does not stop with the scoring system. Each team consists of 1 male and 1 female player, and the team payout is also split equally, no matter the individual score of the player. We will have no problem capturing fans from any gender preference.

Our final advantage is the tournament payouts. Currently, the largest individual purse being offered for a 3-day tournament was $33,000. FLI Golf is offering the winning team $100,000 for a 1-day tournament! Each team that plays in a FLI Golf tournament will leave with a check no matter where they finish. With this type of payout format, we will ensure that the top world players agree to participate in each and every tournament.

The Business

The FLI Golf League is a series of non PDGA sanctioned tournaments. This means players will receive no professional tour points for participating or winning our tournaments. To qualify for our tournaments, you must receive a formal invitation to play and be listed as a top player in the world. Learning from the many sports leagues that have come and gone over the years, we know that trying to compete with an organization with such a small field of top-tier players only offers us obstacles. However, by creating an exhibition style tournament, we will steer clear of those issues.

FLI Golf is a disc golf league that will operate on many different business parallels. The primary areas are sports marketing, sports production, entertainment, professional athlete management, sports tour management, and brand awareness. Each of these will play a vital role in the success of the FLI Golf League. 

Being able to properly market not only our brand, but as the directors of the entire league, the league itself within the worldwide sport of disc golf is crucial and requires tremendous amounts of insight into the sport. Management has been studying the marketing efforts of disc golf and the major influencing groups. Due to low financial support, even the highest-level influencers can be recruited with minimal financial commitments. Also, with management’s close ties to media and telecommunications companies such as IHeart Radio and Easy Choice Wireless, our audience reach is set to cover nationwide. Leveraging these relationships in player contracts can allow for additional use of players social platforms. 

One of the pillars of the FLI Golf league is our production value. This is a key element in not only player acquisition and management, but also the value of the league itself. Through our strategic partnership with PURE Mobile Productions, we can expect the highest level of live sports production that exists in the market. Their ability to understand the playing field of any competitive environment makes them a front runner for every major sports production contract. With FLI Golf’s commitment to creating a compact and intimate fan/player experience, we are matched by PURE Mobile Production’s commitment to providing a first-class product and live fan experience.
 
With a fast-paced social environment, celebrity entertainment and interaction has risen to the forefront of audience capture. The rising growth in popularity in disc golf has made its way to celebrity level players such as world-renowned comic Bert Kreischer, celebrity chef Andrew Zimmern, and Game of Thrones star Kristofer Hivju just to name a few. Due to the sport’s natural fitness application, it’s no surprise that professional athletes have gotten involved as well. Names such as Olympic athlete and UCF fighter Ben Ashren, NFL legend Teddy Bruschi, and even professional golfers such as Bubba Watson. Watson not only plays disc golf, but he also has his own course and hosts his own tournament every year. Harnessing these celebrity level platforms, we will capture the attention of audiences would-wide and create an unforgettable live fan experience.

FLI Golf’s entertainment value continues with the check ceremony. This is not only where sports history will be made and the largest purse amounts in history will be handed out by our celebrity host, the ceremony will culminate with a live musical act. This act will be carefully selected based on audience demographic as well as local fan preferences. The key to the performance is audience capture beyond the sport of disc golf. With the average mainstream band accumulating 500,000 social media followers, this is not just a fan opportunity, but an invaluable marketing opportunity. With the proper host, this event will be an entire event in and of itself.

As previously stated, our knowledge and insight into the current disc golf market is not just concentrated on fan experience and business success, but also aimed at building successful relationships with the key players in the sport. The top players in disc golf are in a state of unrest due to minimal financial gains and recognition with weeks and weeks of travel and physical commitment given to remain relevant, players are switching sponsors and speaking out against the current governing bodies on a weekly basis. With this knowledge, FLI Golf has created a player’s friendly environment that will honor their skills and help secure their sprots carrier legacy. Player options like course layout consultation, lodging accommodations, large 1-day tournament purses, high value sponsor gift baskets, and most importantly new sponsorship opportunities with mainstream sports production will ensure player commitment and contract cooperation.

FLI Golf is not just a one and done tournament. Our 3-phase buildout will have us hosting 24 tournaments, and that’s just the beginning. This is why we have targeted a major sports tour management firm to assist FLI Golf in tour management and execution. With successful music, sports, and local political tours under their belt, there is no entertainment tour setting or environment they are not familiar with. Our host venue will also play a vital role in this process.

Entering an established sport of over 40 years can be risky, however, the industry is primed and ready for a brand to lead the sport of disc golf market value. Partnerships with innovators in brand management and brand exposure with swiftly curate the public response we are seeking.  Every sport has “Top Tier Brands”, however, with the major demographic of disc golf existing within economically divided communities, this spot in the disc golf community is undefined. FLI Golf will focus on modern market trends within the branding and sports apparel communities. Limited edition collections and major brand collaborations will fuel market expansion.

FLI Golf’s Products and Services:

With strategic marketing and branding partners, FLI Golf will be a leading brand in the sport of disc golf. With a focus on a high-end product line intertwined with cost effective apparel options, FLI Golf will penetrate every level of disc golf enthusiasts. Leading categories include discs, baskets, and FLI Golf clothing. We will also have a strong focus on popular brand collaborations. This model creates opportunities for every economic level.

Our Tier 2 sponsors will consist of 4 (four) established disc golf brands, with the first being a basket company. Baskets are a constant topic in the disc golf world between players. Preferences vary from player to player, so we will provide an opportunity for a basket company to showcase a variety of basket options at each tournament.

Discs are the obvious second focus for our product line. There are disc brands that are now infiltrating major sports sponsorships in leagues such as the NHL. We will partner with the target brand and have the FLI Golf brand of discs created as a collaboration to ensure immediate disc golf audience capture.

Our clothing line is broken down into 2 parts. We are looking for a single U.S based brand and a single international brand. With the rapid growth of disc golf worldwide, we need to ensure that we have international brands in the fold. With disc golf being played in every single state and many players willing to play in inclement weather, clothing options and apparel options are endless.

Corporate Office

The FLI Golf office will be in Carlsbad, CA. With the heavy influence of every major golf brand located here, this is a perfect location to attract large sponsors as we move forward. Also, the second most popular course in the world is in San Diego, right down the road. The office will consist of a retail shopping experience, corporate offices, and a warehouse where our courses are built, and obstacles are created. This is like Santa’s Workshop but for disc golf fans! We will be adding observation areas so fans can watch as obstacles are created, or VIP visitors can help us test out a new obstacle. This is in preparation for a potential sports reality tv show or documentary on the creation of the league.

Market & Industry Overview:

The sport of disc golf is estimated to be valued at $199 million in 2023. These same business reports project that the sport will be worth $750 million by 2030. We are in the middle of a huge increase in disc golf growth worldwide but there has been no brand or tournament to rise to the top. FLI Golf, overnight, will become the largest brand and most talked about event across the globe. Management believes that FLI Golf and its partners will be the true catalyst for this elevation. 

PLEASE REVIEW THE FAQ SECTION FOR MORE INDUSTRY AND MARKET INFORMATION.

FLI Golf’s research into the market has led us to understanding the current pain points of fans, sponsors, and players. The issues mainly seem to stem from the current governing body’s inability to keep up with the changing world of sports and make the changes needed to attract new sponsors and enhance live tournament viewership. We have observed top post casts where world ranked players didn’t understand the scoring system of the tour they were on. Issues like this and the lack of communication are causing discomfort between the players and people in charge of the PDGA. This provides opportunities for us with both parties.

There has also been consistent talk about players and brands parting ways. There is even a top world player in the middle of a lawsuit with their previous sponsor over contract obligations. Without clearly defined tournaments, clearly defined rules, and clearly defined contracts, these issues will continue to arise for these organizations. With a clearly defined schedule, player agreement, points system, and rulebook, FLI Golf will be the player and brand tournament choice within the sport.  


Competition 

Simply put, FLI Golf tournaments will be unmatched with anything happening in the sport of disc golf today. The individuals who make decisions with the pro tours of the sport have clearly committed to maintaining the historic layout and tournament format, making the elevation of the sport nearly impossible. Instead of viewing any current brand or tournament organization as competition, we see each one of them as a collaboration possibility that could enhance both of our market share positions.


Financial Projections:

FLI Golf is looking to secure $7 million from a Title Sponsor and tournament host. These funds will allow us to secure the remaining $7 million in sponsorships available in 2024 as well as finalize the agreements with our remaining tour management and marketing partners. By the beginning of 2025, FLI Golf league projects to have collected a total of $14 million in year-1 sponsorships. This revenue will be assisted by early social media revenue streams such as early ticket sales and merchandise sales. 

With the continued growth in television viewership as the tournaments continue, streaming and broadcasting contracts will continue to be more lucrative as well. Owning the live moments of our tournaments will prove to be the largest contributed revenue stream for the FLO Golf League outside of sponsorship revenue. Recreational sports broadcasting contracts currently exist in the market for over $3 million per season.

Ticket sales can vary depending on a few different things, the first of which is the size of our host venue. Larger locations can provide a larger opportunity for out-of-town fans and disc golf supporters. Specific financial projection ca be created once our host sponsor is secured. 

Clothing and apparel sales will also depend on the brand partners we secure. We will not be handling the manufacturing and warehousing of clothing and apparel for the first 3 years. By focusing on brand collaborations and “limited edition” gear, our overhead remains low, and our brand becomes highly sought after. Exclusivity is the key to successful brands launched right now in sports. FLI Golf branded gear can only be bought at our corporate office or at the live tournaments. All other apparel will be sold through collaborative efforts with other brands.

Please see Phase 1 & 2 overviews for detailed Financial Projections for each season. 

FLI Golf’s sustainable competitive advantage through a 3-Phase buildout:

Entering a sport as established as disc golf requires not just exciting and new opportunities, but a game plan that extends past the current sport market and looks to absorb support from disc golf communities that are in their infancy stages. FLI Golf has created a 3-phsase buildout of our league that will solidify our reach not only within the disc golf communities, but the next generation and international fans as well. By carefully planning our partners for each phase and choosing locations that are saturated with the disc golf community, this buildout will be successful. 

Phase 1 is focused on the absorption of the U.S based disc golf scene and capturing the attention of the main sports broadcasting networks. These will be the keys to securing our necessary sponsors and generating the revenue needed to move forward. New and exciting formats for game play and energy charged crowds will provide fresh sponsorship dollars and player commitments. With our host venue being a casino, the entertainment value added to our celebrities and musical acts will make FLO Golf the only topic of discussion on social media forums and our brand solidification will be complete within disc golf and nationwide sports.

Phase 2 will focus on capturing the next generation of players and open our league up to new venue locations sponsorship opportunities as well. Through a strategic partnership with the CDGL (College Disc Golf League), we have secured partnership with the largest college campuses in the United States. We have targeted 6 of the largest colleges with disc golf programs participating in the CDGL, and FLI Golf will be making those campuses our home for 1 tournament each. We will build our custom course throughout the campus and of course have our production partner capturing every moment across these prestigious schools. The publicity our tour will bring to an underfunded college sport program will be priceless to the college campus and provide another main sports stage to highlight the school and their commitment to healthy, gender equal sports. Also, there are many brands that seek opportunities to be seen on major college campuses but are not able to find appropriate organizations to do so.

Phase 3 has only direction to go, international tournaments. With 5 countries represented in the world top 25 players between the male and female rankings, we will already have every major international disc golf brand and organizations attention. Our international brand partner and players will be vital in building these relationships. Securing international attention is crucial from the continues growth and revenue stream for the league moving forward and will ensure that our league has a home anywhere we want to take the sport of disc golf worldwide.

Key points of the FLI Golf 3-phase buildout:

•	Phase 1: Secure disc golf community of players and major brands, influencers and personalities, and the major sports networks or streaming apps. Establish the home venue for the FLI Golf League Season 1.

Marketing Strategy

The details of our overall marketing strategy will be determined when we have finalized the contracts with our marketing partner. However, the marketing direction will consist of high energy ads and influencer-based advertising campaigns. With only 10 major podcasts and less than 50 major influencers worldwide in the sport and most of them underfunded, we will have tremendous success with our influencer campaigns. In addition to influencers, the celebrity host we will have at easy tournament offer additional marketing opportunities that will be explored.

Marketing options extend past traditional marketing avenues when it comes to the sport of disc golf. The sport has already become a popular sport in the digital world. The sport of disc golf is already available for live betting options via crypto currency and crypto platforms. Communication platforms such as discord will be key to capturing this community of fans and financial supporters of the sport. This marketing angle will be key for our FLI Golf Fantasy League.
