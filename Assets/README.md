# Asset Repository README

Welcome to the `Assets` directory of the Fli Golf Collaboration repository. This directory houses various media, branding materials, and other downloadable assets related to the Fli Golf Disc League.

## Structure

- **Images**: Photos, logos, graphics, and other image files.
- **PDFs**: Brochures, pamphlets, manuals, and other document files.
- **Branding**: Consists of branding materials such as logos, color palettes, typography guidelines, and more.
- **Media**: Video clips, audio files, or any other multimedia content.

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Respect Copyright**: Ensure that you have the right to upload, share, and use all assets stored in this directory. Do not upload copyrighted materials without proper authorization.

2. **Optimize Files**: Before uploading, especially images, please ensure they are optimized for size without compromising on quality. This ensures that our repository remains efficient and nimble.
3. **Descriptive Filenames**: When adding a new file, name it descriptively to reflect its content or purpose. For example, `Fli-Golf-Logo-2023.png` rather than `newlogo.png`.

4. **Document Source or Usage Rights**: For each asset that's uploaded, especially if it's not originally created by our team, ensure there's documentation on its source or the rights we have to use it.

5. **Modification**: If you're altering an existing asset (like updating a logo or editing an image), consider keeping the original version in case we need to revert or reference it in the future.

## Contribution

When adding new assets:

1. Create a new branch with a name indicating the assets you're adding or updating.
2. Use pull requests to merge your changes to the main branch. This allows for review and ensures quality control.
3. Always add a brief description in your commits explaining the assets added or any changes made.

## Access & Download

All team members have access to download and use these assets for Fli Golf-related activities. If external parties require access, please get in touch with [Primary Contact's Name] at [email@example.com].

Thank you for maintaining the integrity and organization of our asset repository.
